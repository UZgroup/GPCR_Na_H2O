Updates to come: 

tidy up our SSI/CoSSI functions so that they operate directly on a distribution rather than the directory containing files with distributions
-make it so the coSSI is between two inputs and always includes the binary distribution, and the SSI is directly between simulation and residues
-add the input info directly into the code so we do not need to import any 'inputinfo0' files.
-generalise the concatenation of the trajectories into a function to smooth it up for generalised coSSI between any residues
COMPLETE

tidy up state limit function so that it can operate directly on distribution rather than filesystems. Very minor bug fixing required 
to eliminate visual inspection of state discretizing function.
COMPLETE

Update periodic correction so that it is generalised for both waters and residues, or 
any distribution with any periodic limit definition (e.g. [0,360] or [-180,180]).

Update state_limit finding function to ensure reproducibility and correct discretiation of obscure distributions.

Automate the water pocket definition so no pre-defined c-alphas are needed.
