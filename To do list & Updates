Updates to come: 

tidy up our SSI/CoSSI functions so that they operate directly on a distribution rather than the directory containing files with distributions
-make it so the coSSI is between two inputs and always includes the binary distribution, and the SSI is directly between simulation and residues
-add the input info directly into the code so we do not need to import any 'inputinfo0' files.
-generalise the concatenation of the trajectories into a function to smooth it up for generalised coSSI between any residues
    
tidy up state limit function so that it can operate directly on distribution rather than filesystems. Very minor bug fixing required to eliminate visual inspection of state discretizing function.

Automate the water pocket definition so no pre-defined c-alphas are needed (I think this step will be a massive advance in GPCR/protein analysis â€“ currently no one does this. I have very clear idea for this.)
